# Development Phases

This plan translates the current product and architecture decisions into an implementation sequence.

Related documents:

- `docs/decisions/computer-mesh-operon-summary.md`
- `docs/architecture/technology-and-protocol-decisions.md`
- `README.md`

## MVP Goal

Operon v0.1 should prove this:

```text
Across two machines that are already reachable through Cloudflare Mesh,
Tailscale, WireGuard, SSH, LAN, Kubernetes networking, or manual private
endpoints, users can discover capabilities, run fs/job operations, and
receive a structured execution trace through the CLI/SDK.
```

The MVP is not about building networking infrastructure. It is about proving the capability runtime.

## MVP Non-goals

Do not build these in v0.1:

- VPN
- NAT traversal
- relay network
- device mesh IP assignment
- global routing
- automatic network discovery
- FUSE / WinFsp mount layer
- screen streaming
- audio
- clipboard sync
- full file synchronization engine
- Web Console
- plugin system
- complex policy language
- full secret manager

```

Done when:

- workspace compiles
- CI runs basic checks
- README and decision docs agree on project scope

## Phase 1: Node Runtime and Manual Network

Status: Completed.

Goal: run real daemons on already-reachable nodes.

Current status: completed on 2026-04-30 with Docker two-node validation.

Completed:

- `operond start --listen <addr> --node-id <id>` implemented.
- daemon exposes `GET /health`.
- daemon exposes `GET /node`.
- manual YAML endpoint config is loadable.
- `operon node list` implemented.
- `operon node ping <node-id>` implemented for Phase 1 `http://` endpoints.
- `examples/nodes.yaml` includes a local endpoint.
- local validation passed with `operond` on `127.0.0.1:7788` and `operon node ping local`.
- Docker two-node validation added through `docker-compose.yml`, `docker/Dockerfile`, `examples/docker-nodes.yaml`, and `scripts/verify-phase1-docker.sh`.
- Docker two-node validation passed with `node-a` and `node-b`.

Remaining:

- None for Phase 1.

Commands:

```bash
operond start --listen 0.0.0.0:7788
operon node list
operon node ping cloud-a
```

Configuration:

```yaml
nodes:
  local:
    endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:7788
  cloud-a:
    endpoint: http://100.96.12.34:7788
```

Modules:

- `operond`: daemon lifecycle
- `operon-network`: manual endpoint resolver
- `operon-core`: shared health and node info types
- `operon-cli`: node commands

Implementation notes:

- assume TCP reachability
- do not auto-discover nodes
- do not provision network connectivity
- separate node identity from network endpoint

Done when:

- Docker two-node validation passes locally or in CI
- CLI can ping a remote daemon
- CLI can show remote node identity and basic metadata

Notes:

- Real private-network two-machine validation is not required for Phase 1; Docker two-node validation is sufficient because Operon intentionally treats network connectivity as an external dependency.
- HTTPS support is deferred until identity/auth requirements are designed.
- Generated gRPC or a formal HTTP client can replace the temporary hand-written HTTP client in a later protocol phase.

## Phase 2: Capability Discovery

Status: Not started.

Goal: nodes can declare machine-readable capabilities.

Initial capability kinds:

```text
fs
process
job
device-info
service
```

Command:

```bash
operon capability list cloud-a
```

Example output:

```text
cloud-a/fs:workspace read,write
cloud-a/process:default run
cloud-a/job:default run,cancel,logs
cloud-a/device-info:default read
```

Capability metadata should include:

- id
- kind
- node id
- exposed name
- permissions
- resource constraints
- human-readable description

Done when:

- daemon exposes capability list over protocol
- CLI renders capabilities
- capability IDs can be referenced by later execution steps

## Phase 3: Filesystem Capability

Status: Not started.

Goal: make remote filesystem operations work through protocol calls, without mount support.

Commands:

```bash
operon fs stat cloud-a:/workspace/README.md
operon fs list cloud-a:/workspace
operon fs read cloud-a:/workspace/a.txt
operon fs write cloud-a:/workspace/a.txt --content "hello"
```

MVP operations:

- stat
- list
- read stream
- write stream

Deferred operations:

- delete
- watch
- sync
- mount
- cache coherence

Requirements:

- paths must be constrained by configured mounts
- arbitrary host root access must be impossible
- read/write permissions must be enforced
- large files must stream instead of buffering fully
- every operation must emit audit events

Done when:

- a remote node exposes one configured directory
- CLI can stat/list/read/write inside that directory
- path traversal outside the mount is rejected
- audit records show allowed and denied fs operations

## Phase 4: Process and Job Capability

Status: Not started.

Goal: run controlled commands remotely and stream their lifecycle.

Commands:

```bash
operon job run cloud-a -- "echo hello"
operon job run gpu-node --cwd /workspace -- "python train.py"
operon job logs <job-id>
operon job status <job-id>
operon job cancel <job-id>
```

MVP features:

- run command
- cwd allowlist
- env allowlist
- stdout/stderr streaming
- exit code
- timeout
- cancel
- job record

Deferred features:

- PTY
- interactive shell
- container sandbox
- resource limits
- secret injection

Requirements:

- jobs must be bounded by policy
- stdout/stderr must stream as events
- exit status must be queryable after completion
- cancellation must be best effort but observable

Done when:

- remote command execution works
- logs stream live
- completed jobs can be queried
- cancelled and timed-out jobs are represented correctly

## Phase 5: Operon Execution Graph

Status: Not started.

Goal: compose capability calls into a traceable execution unit.

Example:

```yaml
name: train-model

steps:
  - id: read-data
    node: nas
    action: fs.read
    path: /data/images

  - id: train
    node: gpu-node
    action: job.run
    command: python train.py

  - id: save-model
    node: cloud-a
    action: fs.write
    path: /models/output
```

Commands:

```bash
operon run examples/train-model.yaml
operon trace show <run-id>
```

MVP graph fields:

- run id
- step id
- node
- action
- status
- started_at
- ended_at
- logs
- error
- output/artifact metadata

Scheduling:

- v0.1 should execute steps sequentially
- no complex DAG scheduler in MVP

Done when:

- YAML steps execute in order
- each step has structured status
- failure identifies the failed step and reason
- trace can be inspected after execution

## Phase 6: Minimal Policy and Audit

Status: Not started.

Goal: make capability use explicit, scoped, and traceable.

Example node policy:

```yaml
nodes:
  cloud-a:
    endpoint: http://100.96.12.34:7788
    capabilities:
      fs:
        mounts:
          - name: workspace
            path: /home/ubuntu/workspace
            permissions:
              read: true
              write: true
              delete: false
      job:
        allow:
          - cwd: /home/ubuntu/workspace
```

MVP policy:

- fs mount allowlist
- fs read/write/delete permission flags
- job cwd allowlist
- job timeout
- env allowlist
- subject node id

Audit event fields:

- subject
- timestamp
- node
- capability
- action
- resource
- allowed or denied
- policy reason
- run id
- step id

Done when:

- denied operations are blocked
- allowed and denied operations create audit records
- traces can link to audit events
- policy is simple enough to reason about in examples

## Phase 7: Minimal SDK and Demo Packaging

Status: Not started.

Goal: expose the MVP through an agent-friendly SDK and a runnable demo.

TypeScript SDK shape:

```ts
await operon.run({
  steps: [
    { node: "cloud-a", action: "fs.read", path: "/workspace/a.txt" },
    { node: "gpu-node", action: "job.run", command: "python train.py" }
  ]
})
```

SDK should call the local daemon HTTP facade, not require consumers to speak gRPC directly.

Required demo:

```text
two machines:
  local
  cloud-a

workflow:
  1. write a file to cloud-a workspace
  2. run a command on cloud-a
  3. read the output
  4. show the execution trace
```

Demo command:

```bash
operon run examples/copy-and-run.yaml
```

Done when:

- README demo can be run from a fresh checkout
- SDK can submit a run request
- trace output is useful for humans and agents

## MVP Definition of Done

v0.1 is complete when:

- `operond` runs on at least two machines
- nodes are connected through manually configured reachable endpoints
- CLI can discover remote capabilities
- fs stat/list/read/write work through configured mounts
- job run/logs/status/cancel work for controlled commands
- `operon run` executes sequential YAML steps
- every run produces a structured trace
- basic policy blocks out-of-scope fs/job operations
- audit records capture allowed and denied actions
- README demo can be reproduced

## Post-MVP Phases

### v0.2: Provider Adapters and Secrets

- Cloudflare Mesh endpoint adapter
- Tailscale endpoint adapter
- SSH endpoint adapter
- SecretCapability MVP
- stronger node identity and trust establishment
- better error model

### v0.3: Mounts and Developer Experience

- FUSE / WinFsp mount adapter
- richer CLI output
- local caching strategy
- LAN mDNS discovery
- Kubernetes service discovery
- improved examples

### v0.4: Web Console and Advanced Capabilities

- Web Console
- screen/input capability
- clipboard capability
- service/port access capability
- richer policy language
- trace visualization

## Planning Principle

Every phase should preserve the core boundary:

```text
Cloudflare Mesh / Tailscale / WireGuard / SSH / LAN solve connectivity.
Operon solves what connected machines are allowed to do, how execution is
composed, and how results are traced.
```
